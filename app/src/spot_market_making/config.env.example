# The code uses a simplified version of Avellaneda & Stoikov’s inventory strategy. The market making buy/sell order price is
# controlled by SPREAD_PROPORTION_MINIMUM, SPREAD_PROPORTION_MAXIMUM, and the available base/quote capital via a linear
# relationship. The price moves from
# SPREAD_PROPORTION_MINIMUM to SPREAD_PROPORTION_MAXIMUM when the inventory moves from INVENTORY_BASE_QUOTE_RATIO_TARGET to
# one asset completely depleted. The market making buy/sell
# order quantity is controlled by ORDER_QUANTITY_PROPORTION and the available total capital.
# See https://medium.com/open-crypto-market-data-initiative/simplified-avellaneda-stoikov-market-making-608b9d437403 for
# more details.

# In live trade, paper trade, and backtest mode, the program saves private data as CSV files in PRIVATE_DATA_DIRECTORY for
# performance analysis.

# For paper trade mode and backtest mode, see section "only applicable to paper trade and backtest" below to set additional
# parameters. Simulated order matching for market making order is based on real trades from the live market. See
# https://medium.com/open-crypto-market-data-initiative/the-nitty-gritty-of-paper-trading-a-market-making-strategy-792e08116296
# for more details. Simulated order matching for market taking order is based on real order books from the live market.

# For backtest mode, see section "only applicable to backtest" below to set additional parameters. The program expects daily
# historical market data CSV files in HISTORICAL_MARKET_DATA_DIRECTORY with the following names and formats. For example,
# File name: gemini__eth-usd__2021-07-01__market-depth.csv. This file contains BBO data at each second. OK to be sparse, meaning
# a missing second is assumed to contain the same data as its previous second.
# File format:
# time_seconds,bid_price_bid_size,ask_price_ask_size
# 1625097600,2271.58_1.6477,2279.63_28.479526
# ...
# File name: gemini__eth-usd__2021-07-01__trade.csv. This file contains trade data for every tick.
# File format:
# time_seconds,price,size,is_buyer_maker
# 1625097621.647,2278.15,0.0409,1
# ...
# You can choose to get the data from any vendor. If you choose https://github.com/crypto-chassis/cryptochassis-data-api-docs,
# you can use a convenience script app/script/download_historical_market_data.py. For example,
# python3 download_historical_market_data.py --exchange gemini --base-asset eth --quote-asset usd --start-date 2021-07-01
# --end-date 2021-07-03 --historical-market-data-directory <any-location-you-like>
